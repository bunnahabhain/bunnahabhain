Hello, and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
======================

I am a software engineering manager with an extensive background in software development.

My current interests are Ruby on Rails, and iOS development. All of my work is on private repositories, so there isn't too much to see here at the moment. Seeing that Rails 7 just came out (and there is so much goodness to learn about), I plan to create a sample repo or two as I navigate through the new features.
